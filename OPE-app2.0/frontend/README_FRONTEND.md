## Angular CLI Installation Guide (If you read the backend readme.txt, you can skip this part)
1. Go to the Node.js website and download the latest version of  Node.js
Here is a link to their website: https://nodejs.org/en

3. Write the command 

>npm install -g @angular/cli

then press enter to download the Angular CLI to your pc.

It is **HIGHLY** recommended that you do this in your C Drive.
You will know that you are in C drive if the cmd shows something like this

C:\

4. In the Command Terminal, navigate your way into the frontend folder of the OPE_2.0 folder.

For those who dont use cmd, if the folder is in another drive other than C, you can write the following commands:

>cd\
*>#:

*Note: replace the hashtag with any other letter depending which drive the folder is located like C, D, E and etc.*

then in your File Explorer, shift + right click the folder, then press "copy as path"

write the command:

>cd

then press ctrl+v to paste the path, remove the double quotation marks then enter.

5. when in the frontend folder, write the command:

>npm install

to download all resources and dependencies that you will need to run the website
Note: you will need alot of storage space since there are alot of dependencies required to start the website, same for the backend

6. If all dependencies are downloaded, you can run the website by using the command:

>npm start
